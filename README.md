# Fundamentals of Computer Graphics
Main Physically-Based Rendering algorithms

This repository contains the code written for the course of [<i>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</i> 2020/21](https://pellacini.di.uniroma1.it/teaching/graphics20d/index.html) held by Prof. [Fabio Pellacini](https://pellacini.di.uniroma1.it) at Sapienza University. Homeworks consisted of implementing features for path tracers using [Yocto/GL](https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl) libraries.
The provided directories in the repository refer to a specific course topic. In each of them there is:
<ul>
  <li>a "code" directory including the delivered code for the corresponding homework</li>
  <li>an "out" directory including the rendered scenes</li>
  <li>a "readme.md" file describing the features to implement</li>
</ul>
